For deploying onto website, run "make html", then copy the contents of _static/html/ to the server.

Note that you might need to run the following to install packages for making:
sudo pip install sphinx_bootstrap_theme
sudo pip install recommonmark

If you wish to update the hyperparams page, be sure to first run the autogenerate python script before running "make html".
